# Brief Explenation about the game and code

i try to replicate Honkai Star Rail games, unfortunely dont have much time left 
so in this code i try my best to replicate it. 

some of the challenges when i do this was creating the Character script for each character 
because in honkai star rail they have a lot different character and also animation so i try to make a paraent for that 
you can found it on Character.cs and CharacterAbility. 

and also as for AI on Honkai Star Rail each enemy have their own path 
1.Move
2.Patrol
3.Attack

this is also a challenges for me because i also need to make the AI as clean as possible. 

another chanllenges for me was try to make the script to follow Solid principle.


## In-Game Play
just go near enemy wait for several second (2 second/3 second ) and it will attack you. 


Thank you have a great day!
